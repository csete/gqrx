This branch has re-enabled the GNU Radio audio sink in order to support operating systems that have no pulseaudio port.


Gqrx is an experimental software defined radio receiver implemented using GNU Radio and the Qt GUI toolkit. Currently it works on Linux and it can use the Funcube Dongle, RTL2832U-based DVB-T dongle and USRP devices by Ettus Research as input source.

The following sections are some very generic instructions for building the latest v2.1-git series.


1. Dependencies

- GNU Radio (gnuradio-core and gnuradio-audio)
- At least one of:
    - gr-fcd
    - gr-uhd
    - RTL-SDR from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/rtl-sdr/
    - Osmo SDR from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/osmo-sdr/
- GR OsmoSDR from http://cgit.osmocom.org/cgit/gr-osmosdr/
- pulseaudio
- Qt 4.7 or later and Qt Creator.


2. Installation

Get the latest code from: https://github.com/csete/gqrx
Open gqrx.pro in Qt Creator and click build.


3. Usage

If you have been running pre-2.1, please delete $HOME/.config/gqrx/*
Gqrx will now open a device configuration dialog when you start and it will automatically detect all supported devices that are plugged in.

If you don't see your device it could be that you forgot to add the udev rule to /etc/udev/rules.d/
You can test your device first with rtl_test, qthid, or uhd_usrp_probe that come wit the respective packages.


4. Known problems

- Opening the IO device configurator and pressing OK with the
  same device will crash the application.
- Only works on Linux.
- Device arguments not documented.
- Only tested with Funcube Dongle and RT2832U-based devices.
- Funcube Dongle will not work on systems with libusb-1.0.9 (try gqrx-2.0 instead)


5. Getting help and reporting bugs

There is now a Google group for discussing anything related to Gqrx: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/gqrx
This include getting help with installation and troubleshooting.
